## Overview

Analysis of measurements table in Hawaii.sqllite database. The project uses python and SQLAlchemy to retrieve temperature for the month of June and December. The resulting value was converted in to a list and then Dataframe. We leveraged describe() function of python to get the summary statistics of our result. Project was completed using Juypter notebook

### Deliverables

·       Deliverable 1: Result provided summary statistics of temperature information for the month of June. We were able to get values like

o   Count of 1700

o   Mean of 74.94

o   STD of 3.26

o   Min of 64.00

o   25% at 73.0

o   50% at 75

o   75% at 77.0

o   Max at 85.0

 

·       Deliverable 2: Result provided summary statistics of temperature information for the month of December. We were able to get similar statistics above. Details in code

o   Count of 1517

o   Mean of 71.04

o   STD of 3.74

o   Min of 56.0

o   25% at 69.0

o   50% at 71.0

o   75% at 74.0

o   Max at 83.0

### Results

·       Mean difference; we have mean of 74.94 in June versus December which is 71.04

·       Standard deviation is less in June versus December

·       The minimum in June is 64 versus December which is 56

### Summary

Based on the analysis and comparison of both summary information of June versus December, we were able to discover that the STD of the month of June is lower with a value of 3.26 versus the STD of December which is 3.74. The information provided us temperature information and comparison for month of June and December, the information provided will help W.Avy understand more about building the Surf and ice cream shop and its sustainability year-round
